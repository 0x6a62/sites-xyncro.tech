title: Chiron 6 Available!
project: chiron
---

Chiron 6.0.0 is available. The path to 6 should be straightforward if you're using a 5.x release (and possibly earlier) as we've included backwards compatibility "shims" for functions and operators which are no longer current (where possible -- some provided lenses, etc. have been moved or replaced with more correct implementations). The use of these shims will result in warnings at compile time, but should avoid the requirement for immediate change.

## What's New?

For changes, see the new [Release Notes][release] in the Aether repository.
