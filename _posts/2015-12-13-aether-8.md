title: Aether 8 Available!
project: aether
---

Aether 8.0.0 is available! The path to 8 should be straightforward if you're using a 7.x release (and possibly earlier) as we've included backwards compatibility "shims" for functions and operators which are no longer current (where possible -- some provided lenses, etc. have been moved or replaced with more correct implementations). The use of these shims will result in warnings at compile time, but should avoid the requirement for immediate change.

## What's New?

The big change in Aether 8 is -- simplicity!

Previous versions of Aether have provided many functions and operators for composition and operations, and we've cut that down dramatically in 8, now needing only two composition functions (and operators) and three operation functions (also with operators). That's down from eight and six repsectively before, so the surface of the library is much smaller! Operations are also much simpler, now using a single set of three functions for get, set and map.

For a fuller explanation of the changes, see the new [Release Notes][release] in the Aether repository. The new Aether [Reference][reference] on this site provides a full and up to data API guide, and the new [Guides][guides] give an overview of Aether with the new API.
