Aether 8.0.1 is now available. There are no functional changes, but -- Aether is now a portable library! The NuGet packages for Aether now contain the existing .NET 3.5 and upwards compatible assembly, and an assembly for Profile259, giving the widest range of platform support. Aether should now be happy on .NET Core, Xamarin, etc...
