title: QuickStart
---

This is the place to get started using __Hephaestus__, an open source library for building and working with optimising machines (think state machines for protocol negotiation) in [F#][fsharp]. The simplest way to get started is to get Hephaestus from NuGet:

```shell
PM> Install-Package Hephaestus
```

We're still working on reference content for working with Hephaestus, so in the meantime, keep an eye on the [Updates][updates], and follow [{{ site.twitter.name }}][twitter] on Twitter.

## Packages and Source

For more on available packages for Anat, see the [Packages][packages] section, or if you're interested in the source (contributions are more than welcome) see [Source][source].
