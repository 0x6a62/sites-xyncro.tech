title: QuickStart
---

This is the place to get started using __Chiron__, an open source library for working with JSON in [F#][fsharp]. The simplest way to get started is to get Chiron from NuGet:

{% highlight batch %}
PM> Install-Package Chiron
{% endhighlight %}

We're still working on tutorial and reference content for working with Chiron, so in the meantime, keep an eye on the [Updates][updates], and follow [{{ site.twitter.name }}][twitter] on Twitter.

## Packages and Source

For more on available packages for Chiron, see the [Packages][packages] section, or if you're interested in the source (contributions are more than welcome) see [Source][source].

## Acknowledgements

Chiron has gained various new features and approaches over time thanks to some great contributions. Particular gratitude must go to [Henrik Feldt][feldt], [Marcus Griep][griep] and [Michael Newton][newton] for their contributions, which have made Chiron safer and more useful.
