title: Xyncro Tech
---

[Xyncro Tech][xyncro.tech] is the open source part of [Xyncro][xyncro.com]. It's the home of various projects (see left) that started life as part of Xyncro projects and were then open sourced. They're now useful projects in their own right, with some fantastic collaborators.

We also work on various projects that have their own homes, chiefly [Freya][freya] and related libraries.

See each of the projects for more on what they are and do, as well as how to get them and use them.

## Contributing

We've been lucky to have received fantastic contributions to these projects, but more are always welcome! We are always delighted by any contributions to projects, whether it's code, bug reports, documentation or simply suggestions.

## Updates

For updates on each of the individual projects see the Updates sections, and follow [{{ site.twitter.name }}][twitter].

## Thanks

Open source thrives when people contribute back, and we've been very fortunate to have some excellent contributions from people in the community. Many, many thanks to them.
