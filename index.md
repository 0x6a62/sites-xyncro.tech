# Xyncro Tech

[Xyncro Tech][xyncro.tech] is the open source part of [Xyncro][xyncro.com]. It's the home of various projects (see left) that started life as part of Xyncro projects and were then open sourced and released.

See each of the projects on the left for more on what they are and do, as well as how to get them and use them.

## Contributing

We welcome (more than welcome!) any contributions to any projects, whether it's code, bug reports, documentation or simply suggestions.

## Updates

For updates on each of the individual projects see the Updates section for each, and follow [{{ site.twitter.name }}][twitter].

## Thanks

Open source thrives when people contribute back, and we've been very lucky to have some excellent contributions from people in the community. Many, many thanks to them.
