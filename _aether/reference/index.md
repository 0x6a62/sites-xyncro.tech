Reference material for Aether (in common with other Xyncro projects) is split in to module level sections, corresponding to *"what you have access to when you open module X"*. So the Aether section deals with everything in scope when you open __Aether__, and Aether.Operators deals with additional elements in scope when __Aether.Operators__ is opened.

Note that opening __Aether__, for example, brings in to scope things in various modules which are auto-opened. This is not shown explicitly, instead the functions are shown as they can be used, leaving the physical module structure out, as the developer experience is designed.

Read on for the reference for the [Aether][aether] module.
