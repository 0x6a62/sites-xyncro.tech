Reference material for Aether (in common with other Xyncro projects) is split in to module level sections, corresponding to *"things that opening module X brings in to scope"*. So the [Aether][aether] section deals with everything in scope when you open __Aether__, and [Aether.Operators][aether.operators] deals with additional elements in scope when __Aether.Operators__ is opened.

Note that opening __Aether__, for example, brings in to scope things in various modules which are auto-opened. This is not shown explicitly, instead the functions are shown as they can be used, leaving the physical module structure out, as the developer experience is designed.
