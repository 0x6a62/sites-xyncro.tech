# Quick Start

Hopefully you're here because you're interested in __Aether__, an optics (lenses, prisms, etc.) library for [F#][fsharp]. You might simply want to start with this:

{% highlight batch linenos=table %}
PM> Install-Package Aether
{% endhighlight %}

If you'd like a bit more information however, we've got you covered.

## Tutorials

If you're not familiar with lenses and related ideas in functional programming, you probably want to start with the [Tutorials][tutorials] which will take you through an introduction (including the motivations and ideas), all the way to being comfortable with using Aether.

The [Tutorials][tutorials] section also has a handy section of links to other places discussing lenses, etc. if you want to dig further in, or explore how Aether compares with other language implementations.

## Reference

If you're already familiar with lenses and other optics in functional programming, you probably want to head straight to the [Reference][reference], or even just grab the [Packages][packages] and get started.

## Contributing

Contributions in any form are welcome. The easiest way to contribute is via the main Git repository, linked from [Source][source]

## Acknowledgements

__Aether__ is a much more useful and well designed/tested library now than it was. This owes much to the work of various people (both code and ideas/suggestions). I'm particularly grateful to [Marcus Griep][griep] for his contributions, which have made Aether more reliable and useful.
