# Quick Start

Hopefully you're here because you're interested in __Aether__, an optics library for F#.

If you're not familiar with lenses and related ideas in functional programming, you probably want to start with the [Tutorials][tutorials] which will take you through the motivation and ideas, all the way to being comfortable with using Aether.

The [Tutorials][tutorials] section also has a handy section of links to other places discussing lenses, etc. if you want to dig further in, or explore how Aether compares with other language implementations.

If you're already familiar with lenses and other optics in functional programming, you probably want to head straight to the [Reference][reference], or just straight to grabbing [Packages][packages] and getting started.
