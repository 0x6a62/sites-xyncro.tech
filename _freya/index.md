Freya is a functional web programming stack designed to emphasise functional programming principles, compositionality and high levels of safety and abstraction. It supports multiple web servers and is portable across all servers/environments with OWIN support.

It is significant enough in scope to have it's own site and documentation -- please see [freya.io][freya] for full details.
