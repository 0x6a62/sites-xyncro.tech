title: QuickStart
---

This is the place to get started using __Hekate__, an open source library for working with graphs (in the nodes and edges sense, rather than charting) in [F#][fsharp]. The simplest way to get started is to get Hekate from NuGet:

{% highlight batch linenos=table %}
PM> Install-Package Hekate
{% endhighlight %}

We're still working on reference content for working with Hekate, so in the meantime, keep an eye on the [Updates][updates], and follow [{{ site.twitter.name }}][twitter] on Twitter.

## Packages and Source

For more on available packages for Chiron, see the [Packages][packages] section, or if you're interested in the source (contributions are more than welcome) see [Source][source].
